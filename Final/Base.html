			<h1> It's a couch and a TV </h1>
			<p> 
				Nothing seems to be playing on the TV no matter what channel I switch to. <br><br>
				The couch looks comfortable, of course  it will be, it has to be.
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="table"> 
			<h1> It's a dining table </h1>
			<p> 
				<em>Four</em> chairs were ordered to be put on the table.<br><br>
				How idiotic of me, I only have ordered the one stasis bed, why would I feel the need to
				accomodate more people?
				
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="door_closed"> 
			<h1> It's a locked door </h1>
			<p> 
				It's locked, makes sense, I can't let any contaminated air get into here. Or worse.
				<br><br>
				But if I'll want to get out myself, I'll need to input a code.
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="door_open"> 
			<h1> It's an open door </h1>
			<p> 
				It's open. No turning back now, time to face the world once more.

				<button id="proceed" onclick="proceed()">proceed</button>
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="pc"> 
			<h1> It's a computer </h1>
			<p> 
				I seem to have had a lot of unopened emails, 
				damn basterds can't do anything without me. 
				<br><br>
				"Air Quality: accaptble"
				<br><br>
				Seems that I can go out now, setting the place up for long term living was useless
				after all. Time to greet the masses.
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="trash"> 
			<h1> It's a trash can </h1>
			<p> 
				It's <em>empty</em>, for now.

		<div class="replace" id="kitchen"> 
			<h1> It's a full kitchen set </h1>
			<p> 
				It's stacked with a large veriety of foods and utencils to last <em> seven </em> years.
				<br><br>
				Dammit, I should have brought a chef with me here.
				<br>
				Or at least a cook book.
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="graffiti"> 
			<h1> It's some graffiti </h1>
			<p> 
				Some Doctor must have wrote it before the Stasis.
				<br><br>
				If he is still out there he better be ready to live on the streets.
			<p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="replace" id="bed"> 
			<h1> It's a stasis bed </h1>
			<p> 
				It's a stasis bed, created to let me sleep for a long time 
				without effecting my body.
				<br><br>
				Made just for the purpose of me passing this god awful amount of time. 
				<br><br>
				It seems that the power shut down. well, it wasn't made to last very long.
			<p>
		</div>

			<h1> It's a code panel </h1>
			
				<input type="number" id="code_text">
				<br><br>
				<button id="code_button" onclick="check_code()">CHECK</button>
				<br><br><br><br>
				<p>
					It needs a 4 number code to open the door.
					<br><br>
					I don't remember the code... The numbers are on the tip of my tounge but
					I'll have to guess their order.
