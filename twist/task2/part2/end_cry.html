		<h1> The boy who cried wolf 3 </h1>
		
		<div style = "width:500px;" >
			<p width = "50%"> You cried and whined and where all impressive and whatever but what happened yasterday is unimportant now, 
			THERE ARE ACTUALLY WOLVES HERE THE NEXT DAY! You scream and yell with all your might but NO ONE shows up! So you try to scream even louder, 
			banging on doors begging for people to come. but they still won't come out. From all the noise you are making it seems the wolves have shifted their priority.
			</p>
			
			<p> The next day it is discovered by the villagers that the sheeps are untouched, and they boy in charge of scouting for wolves is nowhere to be seen.
			That little prankster must have run off to play in the woods. surely he will come back. surely... </p>
