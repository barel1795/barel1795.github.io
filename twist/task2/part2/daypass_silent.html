			<p width = "50%"> Another borinng day in the office, or wherever patch of grass you are in, nothing new except that one branch that fell in yasterdays wind.
			You swear that you counted all the leaves in the forest at least twice by now. Maybe the prank idea from yasterday wasn't too bad? Maybe you should actually
			do it today? Wouldn't that be fun?</p>
