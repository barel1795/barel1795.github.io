		<h1> The boy who cried wolf </h1>
		
		<div style = "width:500px;" >
			<p width = "50%"> You are a young boy recently given his first job in the village after coming of age. 
		Your job is to keep track of the forest edge in case wolfs come to eat the herds of sheep.
		It is not that important of a job since only a few sheep are at risk, but it's sooooooo boring.
		you have to wait a long time each day looking at practicaly nothing.
		what are the chances that a wolf would even apear?
		surely a little prank on the village won't do any harm?</p>
