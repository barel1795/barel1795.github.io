		<div style = "width:500px;" >
			<p width = "50%"> The next day you can't believe you eyes, ACTUAL WOLVES!
			immidiatly you yell and scream so all the village could hear and within seconds they rush out. 
			they at once pounce on the attacing beasts with rakes, pans and sticks. 
			The wolves run off into into the forest defeated and hungry.
			</p>
			
			<p> Once the danger is over the vilagers run over to you and lift you up in praise of you fine work before leaving back to their homes.
			maybe this job isn't so bad after all.
