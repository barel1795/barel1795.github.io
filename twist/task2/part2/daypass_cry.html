		<h1> The boy who cried wolf 2 </h1>
		
		<div style = "width:500px;" >
			<p width = "50%"> You cry and scream "WOLVES WOLVES!" trying to as loud and convincing as you can, you are quiet impressed by how high your tones can get.
			You see many village men come out hastily from their homes, grabbing whatever farming equipment they can get to fight of the wolves.
			Many seem to trip over themselves while running, one guy falls in a pig sty completely getting covered in mud, another gets his pants hooked on a fence
			and they get ripped leaving his bottm completely exposed!
			However when everyone arrives at your location they seem confused. "Where are the wolves boy" one asks, but instead of an answer your face bursts in laughter.
			The village men groan and sigh, giving you angry looks before leaving you to your job.</p>
			
			<p>Another boring day comes with nothing in sight. Truly you must have been cursed by god to work the most dull job on the planet.
			But that prank yasterday sure was funny. Sure was... I mean, it wouldn't be too bad if you did it again today? Right?</p>
